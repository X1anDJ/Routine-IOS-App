Please download the ENTIRE repository, 
INCLUDING 
1. git.ignore   (This prevents us from pushing the DerivedData folder)

2. Routine.xcodeproj  (It's tricky to create your own builder file)

Run the project by clicking Routine.xcodeproj

Configure the Routine.xcodeproj accordingly if it cannot build successfully. Path could be changed

User class and Task class requires more discussion
